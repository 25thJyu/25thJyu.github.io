## miya atsumu (amv) - Sony Vegas 14 (June 2020)
 When editing AMVs (anime music videos) I always make sure to edit the video in which the captions, music, and the video itself compliment each other. In this video, I was experimenting with more creative ways to make captions appear and move in accordance to the music. I was also experimenting with different fonts of text that could compliment each other.

## khun (amv) - Adobe After Effects (September 2020)
After using Sony Vegas for a long time, I started to try Adobe After Effects as a new software for editing videos. This time, I focused on transitions and making them cohesive with the song. I also played a lot around with the movement of the videos trying to match the feel of my chosen music. I carefully chose the clips included in this video, choosing those with minute expression/movement change to make the movements be more prominent to see.

## uta (amv) - Sony Vegas 14 (June 2020)
Ever since I came across this specific sound, I already envisioned what character and what kind of transitions I will use with it to the point where it made me restless. I focused on trying to replicate the progression I have in my mind and tried to match the numerous beats of the sound to the clips I used as a form of character study, highlighting small movements and key details of the character's design.

## the promised neverland (amv) - (February 2020)
This AMV is one of the longest I made, in this video, I focused on trying to encapsulate the feeling that watching this anime gave me. This is also one of the videos that I immediately knew the song and the progression that I wanted this AMV to have to fully express the chosen show's psychological aspects.

## ban (amv) - Sony Vegas Pro 13 (January 2020)
In this edit, I only used pictures with minimal and repetitive transitions just to match the song I have picked with the exception of the short blood drip clip. I wanted to see if I can make what I envisioned using pictures.

## dororo (amv) - Sony Vegas Pro 16 (January 2020)
I started messing with the color grading and filters in this edit, as well as the timing of the  videos and pictures with the slow beats of the music.

## your lie in april (amv) - Sony Vegas Pro 15 (May 2018)
Watching this anime made me think of a specific song for months that I had to try my hand on making a music video out of it. I tried to portray the emotions the anime has and weave it into the music. I also played around on the font options of the software.
